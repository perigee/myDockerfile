# Introduction


> Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications. 


#### Consisting of:

- Docker Engine, a portable, lightweight runtime and packaging tool, and 

- Docker Hub, a cloud service for sharing applications and automating workflows;


#### Objectives:
 
- Docker enables apps to be quickly assembled from components and eliminates the friction between development, QA, and production environments. 

- IT can ship faster and run the same app, unchanged, on laptops, data center VMs, and any cloud.

# Different from Virtual Machines 
##### -- ("Dedicated" to Asing)

### Virtual Machines

Each virtualized application includes not only the application - which may be only 10s of MB - and the necessary binaries and libraries, but also an entire guest operating system - which may weigh 10s of GB.


### Docker

The Docker Engine container comprises just the application and its dependencies. It runs as an isolated process in userspace on the host operating system, sharing the kernel with other containers. Thus, it enjoys the resource isolation and allocation benefits of VMs but is much more portable and efficient.

# Definitions

#### Docker images
A Docker image is a read-only template. Images are used to create Docker containers. Docker provides a simple way to build new images or update/download existing images.

#### Docker registries
Docker registries hold images. These are public or private stores from which you upload or download images. The public Docker registry is called *Docker Hub*. 

#### Docker containers
A Docker container holds everything that is needed for an application to run. Each container is created from a Docker image. Docker containers can be run, started, stopped, moved, and deleted. Each container is an isolated and secure application platform.

3. Running container
4. Create image
5. Coordination among containers

---

# Run

1. `docker run`
2. `docker stop`
3. `docker attach`
4. `ctrl+p ctrl+q` unatach the docker container

---

# Create image

```bash

> docker commit

```
